INTRODUCTION                                             *journal* *journal.vim*

The journal plugin provides a way to keep an encrypted journal organized by
days. Upon activation, a calendar will be displayed on the left showing days
on which entries are made.

:JournalToggle          Toggle the journal view. You will see a calendar on the
