INTRODUCTION                                             *journal* *journal.vim*

The journal plugin provides a way to keep a journal organized by days. Upon
activation, a calendar will be displayed on the left showing days on which
entries are made. Encryption is also supported.

REQUIREMENTS                                             *journal-requirements*

Before installing journal.vim, you need to install the following plugin:

calendar.vim  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=52

To use encryption, you need to install GPG support:

gnupg.vim     http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=661
